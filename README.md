# hedracor
Hebrew Drama Corpus


## 2023-09-11/13 workshop plan

* Imrpove the TSVwithHMTLs-to-TEI/XMLs conversion procedure (coding skills required)
* Add metadata from the table into TEI/XML-s (coding skills required)
* Check the correctness of the markup, i.e. if the stage tags actually mark (Hebrew knowledge required, I guess)
* Check if all the critical metadata is there in the table (dates, authors, text sources) and that they made it to the TEI/XML-s intact (Hebrew knowledge required, I guess, but maybe also doable with machine translation)
* Check authors' death dates to see if all the stuff is copyright-free
* Figure out what date from the TSV metadata should be written as written/premiere/publication into TEI/XML
* Showcase study on the stylometry of Hebrew writers 
* Dockerize the stuff and show the locally deployed HeDraCor prototype 

## 2022-11-09 meeting follow-up:

* We looked at some [slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1St-H1dawSyRf4UGV3kVwBw8JFqfmm7ctelpXbmqyjWE/edit?usp=sharing) with details on current DraCor 'onboarding' procedures 
* We discussed sources for the plays:
  * Project Ben-Yehuda (Hebrew)
  * Corpus of Hanoch Levin (Hebrew) -- digitised, but copyright-protected
  * Dybbuk corpus (Yiddish) -- notebooks with plays digitised by Ruthie and Sinai 
* We started a [list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1GushGoKGnJQVe2HxEMlvjz-4Rwr4xbbaRWrbCbjAwXo/edit?usp=sharing) of Hebrew and Yiddish plays (in separate tabs)
* We started a private github repository (this one:) to store our common memory for this working group; we can also use issues there for discussions, as Peer suggested

### Some actions we decided to take:

* Yael & Aynat will update the list of Hebrew plays (preferably with direct links to sources; or if that's easier than links you can instead upload sources to the private github)
* Sinai & Ruthie will update the list of Yiddish plays (but we do not expect this one to be big at the moment)
* Sinai will look for more digitised sources for Yiddish plays (we ask you to prioritise the copyright-free material by the way)
* Everybody will tell Daniil their github name so that he could add them to the  repository. 
* Daniil will look at the sources (especially the already encoded ones) and try some conversion procedures
* We're all looking forward to the DraCor workshop between HUJI and the Free University (fingers crossed for the funding approval -- as Dennis put it, 'the application was well received' :) and hopefully there will be some Hebrew DraCor live meetings. 
* Regardless of the workshop, we intend to meet again online once to discuss the next stage after we explore the existing resources
